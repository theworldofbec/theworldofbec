- 👋 ~ Hola, hello, salut, 헬로! My name is Becca. Nice to meet you!

- 💞️ ~ I’m interested in a little bit of everything: reading books that make you cry, watching TV shows and movies where you can fall in love with the characters, listening to music that can transport you (#방탄소년단 💜), any form of art but sculpture in particular, cycling around my favourite city, drinking yummy coffee or boba tea, and wandering around different places across the world.

- 🌱 ~ I’m currently learning the basics of coding. Any good tips on where to start?

- 📫 ~ If you would like to reach out, all my socials are @theworldofbec - see you there!
